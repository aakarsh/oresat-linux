Welcome to OreSat Linux's documentation!
========================================

Documenation for the embedded Linux boards on OreSat.

The goal of this documentation is to provide a overview of the OreSat Linux
enviroment on OreSat Linux boards, a high level overview of each OreSat Linux
board, and provide any helpful resources/guides for development on OreSat Linux
boards.

.. warning::
    This is still a work in progress.

.. note:: This is **not** the documentation for any of the Cortex-M0 or 
   Cortex-M4 boards running ChibiOS or the ground station software, see 
   `OreSat Firmware`_ or `UniClOGS Software`_ respectively.

What is OreSat?
---------------

OreSat is a open source CubeSat from Oregon by PSAS (Portland State Aerospace
Society).

.. note::

    If you are looking for more info on OreSat, go checkout  
    `OreSat Website`_ and `OreSat GitHub`_

Why Linux?
----------

Some of subsystems on OreSat need extra computing power, so theyâ€™re given
hardware that can run Linux.

Linux is Open Source.

This also remove the restriction of baremetal, allowing software to be written
in languages like Python, Java, Haskell, etc as needed.
